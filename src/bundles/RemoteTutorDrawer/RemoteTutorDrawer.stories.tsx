A broad set of perspectives is provided, covering aspects of business, engineering, science, and technology, including viewpoints from industry, as well as multiple practitioners of the art.</p>\\n<p>The course starts with the concept of noise, its effect on quantum coherence, and the methods used to quantify and represent the impact of noise on physical systems. The course ends with the IBM Q experience, in which you will study how to benchmark qubits and quantum gates in the presence of noise.</p>\\n<p><b>Starting the course</b></p>\\n<p>Please visit your dashboard at&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://mitxpro.mit.edu/dashboard\\" target=\\"[object Object]\\">https://mitxpro.mit.edu/dashboard</a>&nbsp;and click &ldquo;View Course&rdquo; to access the class.</p>\\n<p>The page where you enter is the&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://mitxpro.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxPRO+QCx3+2T2018/course/\\" target=\\"[object Object]\\">COURSE tab</a>.
