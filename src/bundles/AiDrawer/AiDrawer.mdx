<Title />

AiDrawerManager replaces AiDrawer (previously RemoteTutorDrawer) and should be rendered once on the page except for the
case that props cannot be shared across drawer instances. The AiDrawer is not intended to be used directly as AiDrawerManager
now listens for `postMessage()` messages and controls the open state.
