<Title />

The AiDrawerManager listens for `window.parent.postMessage` messages, intended to be posted from within iframes,
and creates an AiDrawer instance (previously RemoteTutorDrawer) for each new message, opening the drawer, while keeping previous instances
mounted after being closed to preserve their state whilst still on the page if the same message is posted to open the drawer.

A single AiDrawerManager instance should be rendered on the parent page. This replaces the need for multiple
AiDrawer instances and `target` props to select the intended drawer.

The instances are keyed on the messages `.payload.chat.chatId` if set. This is the value used by AiChatContext to retrieve
chat sessions from the backend after page reloads. If not set, the message payload itself is used (hashed internally) to key
each instance.

The AiDrawerManager should also be used where there is only a single drawer on the page as the `postMessage()` message event
handler and open/close state have been hoisted from the AiDrawer. For backwards compatibility the AiDrawer
now aliases AiDrawerManager and accepts the same props.

An example use case is within Open edX courses:

- The AiDrawerManager is rendered in the learning MFE.
- It is controlled via messages from XBlock content; the XBlock content is rendered in an iframe within the learning MFE.

To control the drawer, the iframe sends messages via `window.parent.postMessage`. Most configuration is handled via such messages.

## Props

While most inputs are controlled via message events from the iframe, the drawer accepts a few props directly:

<Controls />

Props passed to the AiDrawerManager are shared across AiDrawer drawer instances. If they cannot share props, such as a
case that each drawer is talking to a different chat server and needs individual `fetchOpts` or `transformBody`, render an
AiDrawerManager instance for each, ideally using the AiDrawer alias so the intent is clear.

The message events emitted from iframe should have shape:

```typescript
type ChatInitMessage = {
  type: "smoot-design::chat-open"
  payload: {
    ...settings /** AiDrawerSettings */,
    /**
     * If provided, POST requests will be sent to this URL containing
     * data about how the user interacts with the drawer.
    */
    trackingUrl?: string,
  }
}
```
