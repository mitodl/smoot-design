To understand global warming, I recommend the following resources from MIT:

1. **[Global Warming Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/global-warming/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-global-warming-science)**: This course offered by MITx covers the physics, chemistry, biology, and geology of the earthâ€™s climate system. It's a comprehensive introduction to the scientific principles underlying global warming.

2. **[Global Warming Science](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+12.340x+1T2020/about)**: Another offering of the same course by MITx, available through the Open Learning Library. It provides the same in-depth exploration of the earth's climate system.

These courses are free and provide a solid foundation in understanding the scientific aspects of global warming. They are suitable for anyone interested in the topic, regardless of prior knowledge.

Here are some courses on linear algebra that you can explore:

1. **[Linear Algebra (MIT OpenCourseWare)](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+18.06SC+2T2019/about)**: This course covers matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing topics useful in various disciplines such as physics, economics, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. It parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strang's textbook "Introduction to Linear Algebra." This course is free and available through MIT OpenCourseWare.

2. **[Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance (MITx)](https://www.edx.org/learn/finance/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-mathematical-methods-for-quantitative-finance)**: This course covers the mathematical foundations essential for financial engineering and quantitative finance, including linear algebra, optimization, probability, stochastic processes, statistics, and applied computational techniques in R. It is free and offers certification upon completion.

3. **[Quantum Information Science I, Part 1 (MITx)](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/about)**: While primarily focused on quantum information science, this course requires some knowledge of linear algebra and is suitable for those interested in quantum mechanics. It is free and available through MITx.

These courses provide a comprehensive introduction to linear algebra and its applications across various fields.
